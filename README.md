# Jean Res Swanepoel

Hello, World. I'm Jeanre Swanepoel - a Software Development Consultant & Technology Generalist.

I am a freelance software development consultant from Cape Town, South Africa with over a decade of experience building large-scale software products. As a technology generalist, I bridge the gap between architecture, engineering, and DevOps, focusing on security, scalability, and robust system design.

My approach is to use the best tool for the job, consulting across the entire software development lifecycle - from initial architecture and system design to deployment procedures and infrastructure management. I specialize in re-architecting legacy systems, implementing modern cloud architectures, and leading development teams through complex technical challenges.
